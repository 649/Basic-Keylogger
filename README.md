Basic-Keylogger v1.0
----------------------------------------------------------
Written in C++, very basic Windows keylogger, records all
keystrokes even ones without an input (like tab, arrows).

To stop the keylogger, you must task kill the process.
All strokes are logged and placed in the same directory
as the binaries, it's saved as "LOG.txt". Enjoy.
